## 1.0  (2021/03/25)

The first official release of mergin-db-sync! It includes all the essential functionality to set up and maintain
sync between a Mergin project and a PostgreSQL database.

The tool can be run from CLI on demand with low-level commands (init, pull, push) or it can be started as a daemon
to continuously maintain data in sync. It can be also run using a Docker container: lutraconsulting/mergin-db-sync
